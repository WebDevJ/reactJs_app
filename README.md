# Project Intro
We are going to create a SPA using Postgres (pg-promise) & Express to build an API and a React front-end that consumes it.


## Project Proposal

### Have you ever been to a bad meetUp.com Event in NYC?

* The event was poorly planed and you would of never went if you knew that ahead of time.

* You really **love** what **NYC** has to offer but just can't seem to find that right event or even were to start looking. MeetUp.com can be **overwhelmed** with all those choices. It would be great if there was something that did all that guess work for you.

* Most of all, you didn't have any one to go **with !** Would it not be great if you and your friends could remotely agree to go to an event? Or **Share a Great MeetUp** with the Community that no one has heard of.    **DON'T Worry We Got You!**
## My_NYC_Community_Events.APP
Here at DiamondDogs inc. We believe that there should be an app that takes care of all of this for you. With this exclusive membership to a Community of tried and tested events, you can't go wrong. The best part is that you can see if your friends are going and if any one in the Community as already gone.

**DiamondDogs inc** would like to build this app with the vision of keeping in contact with all of our **Bowie** classmates via fun, active, engaging, NYC events via

#### User Stories:

1. I as a user am prompted with landing page info that tells me what this app is.

2. I as a user see the **CALL TO ACTION** to **SIGN UP** as the 1st option, above other page elements.

3. I as a user know when I am **logged In** or have been registered as a new user, when my **user Dash Board** is displayed on the current page.

4. I as a user can see a list of **Community Events** on my **User Dash Board** and can see the event details for each event.

5. I as a user while viewing the **Community Events** section can clearly see a **Go to this Event** button which then adds selected event to the **My Events** section of my **User Dash Board** and then prompts me that it as been added by changing the button text to **Remove ME** and color to **RED**.

6. I as a user can search & add my own event to the **Community Events** section from my **user Dash Board** and will see **Community Events** updated with **myOwn** event upon making this change.

7. I as a user have the option to see only **My Events** that I am attending or that I created when when I click on the **My Events** button from the  **User Dash Board**. I from here can also edit my event or remove myself from going to a Event.

8. I as a user can change my mind and cancel an event that I created as a **new event** and this button is clearly labeled on the same section as the **My Events** section of my **User Dash Board**.
