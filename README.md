#### User Stories:

1. I as a user am prompted with landing page info that tells me what this app is.

2. I as a user see the **CALL TO ACTION** to **SIGN UP** as the 1st option, above other page elements.

3. I as a user know when I am **logged In** or have been registered as a new user, when my **user Dash Board** is displayed on the current page.

4. I as a user can see a list of **Community Events** on my **User Dash Board** and can see the event details for each event.

5. I as a user while viewing the **Community Events** section can clearly see a **Go to this Event** button which then adds selected event to the **My Events** section of my **User Dash Board** and then prompts me that it as been added by changing the button text to **Remove ME** and color to **RED**.

6. I as a user can search & add my own event to the **Community Events** section from my **user Dash Board** and will see **Community Events** updated with **myOwn** event upon making this change.

7. I as a user have the option to see only **My Events** that I am attending or that I created when when I click on the **My Events** button from the  **User Dash Board**. I from here can also edit my event or remove myself from going to a Event.

8. I as a user can change my mind and cancel an event that I created as a **new event** and this button is clearly labeled on the same section as the **My Events** section of my **User Dash Board**.
